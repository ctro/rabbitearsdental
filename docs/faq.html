    <h2>General Dentistry</h2>
    <h4>Fillings</h4>
    <p>
      Fillings are a conservative approach to treating dental decay.  A wide variety of materials can be used to restore 
      a tooth to normal form and function after the decay has been removed. The quality of composite materials (white fillings) 
      has improved to the point that our office exclusively places these materials for fillings.  This allows our work to 
      achieve the highest standard of aesthetics, long-term success, and conservative tooth preparation.
    </p>
    <h4>Crowns</h4>
    <p>
      Crowns are used on teeth when a full coverage restoration is required to strengthen the remaining tooth structure to 
      prevent fracture and decrease the likelihood of future decay. This may be used after a root canal is performed, after 
      a tooth fractures, or when a large filling in a tooth fails.
    </p>
    <h4>Bridges</h4>
    <p>
      Bridges are a restorative, non-surgical option for replacing single or multiple missing teeth. A crown is placed on 
      each of the teeth adjacent to space where the tooth is missing. Those crowns are connected by a replacement tooth, which 
      bridges the gap of the missing tooth.
    </p>
    <h4>Dentures</h4>
    <p>
      Dentures fully replace an arch of missing teeth on the upper jaw, lower jaw, or both. Dentures may be retained in the 
      mouth in the traditional manner or they may achieve further retention in the mouth through the support of implants. 
      In the event that implants are used, the dentures may be removable from the mouth by snapping in and out of the implants 
      via a button-like attachment. Alternatively, the denture may be permanently attached to the implants via screws and only 
      removable by the dentist.
    </p>
    <h4>Partial Dentures</h4>
    <p>
      Partial dentures are a removable solution for replacing single or multiple missing teeth. Partial dentures use the 
      existing teeth for retention and support. This removable appliance may either be a permanent solution to replacing teeth or may be
      used temporarily.

    <h2>Surgical Dentistry</h2>
    <h4>Implants</h4>
    <p>
      Implants are a surgical option for replacing missing teeth that involves placing a titanium screw into the jaw bone, 
      which heals rigidly via osseointegration. The implant will serve as the foundation for a crown that emerges from the gum tissue. 
    </p>
    <h4>Removal of Wisdom Teeth</h4>
    <p>
      Third molars, commonly referred to as wisdom teeth, may be recommended for removal for a variety of reasons. Lack of space, 
      gum inflammation, and dental decay are common reasons for recommending the removal of wisdom teeth.
    </p>
    <h4>Surgical Extractions</h4>
    <p>
      Extractions become surgical when the tooth must be sectioned into separate roots to facilitate its removal in an atraumatic 
      manner, or when a flap of gum tissue must be created to access the tooth or bone.
    </p>
    <h4>Root Canals</h4>
    <p>
      A root canal may be required when the nerve of a tooth becomes damaged through trauma, cracks, dental decay, or dental treatment. 
    </p>

    <h2>Cosmetic Dentistry</h2>
    <h4>Teeth Whitening</h4>
    <p>
      Teeth whitening is a cosmetic procedure aimed at improving the appearance of the smile and reversing stains present on the teeth. 
      Our office can custom fit a whitening tray, which can be used to whiten your teeth at your discretion. 
    </p>
    <h4>Mouth Guards</h4>
    <p>
      Mouth guards are made for the protection of teeth and the prevention of concussions during athletic events. Professionally made 
      guards provide the most precise fit with the least excess of material.
    </p>
    <h4>Night Guards</h4>
    <p>
      Night guards are often recommended to patients who clench or grind their teeth at night.  In addition to protecting the teeth 
      from further wear, night guards often aid in reducing the neuromuscular symptoms of grinding which includes sore head and neck muscles 
      as well as headaches.
    </p>
    <h4>Preventive Care</h4>
    <p>
      Preventative care is the backbone of our practice. Problems can often be caught at early stages and treated conservatively
      rather than waiting for pain to develop, which typically results in more complicated treatment. Additionally, when seen regularly
      we are able to know your mouth uniquely and treat it individually. Without regular preventative care, it is impossible to achieve 
      the highest level of long-term care.

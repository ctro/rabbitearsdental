    <h2>Dr. Troy Markgraf</h2>
       <hr />
    <p>
      Dr. Troy Markgraf grew up in north Denver and completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Colorado. 
      After graduation, he led a nonprofit supporting underserved youth. Dr. Markgraf’s time with this community exposed 
      him to profound disparities in healthcare access, which ultimately inspired him to pursue a career in dentistry. He 
      earned his DDS from the University of Colorado School of Dental Medicine and has since cared for patients throughout 
      Northern Colorado.
      </p>
  <p>
Dr. Markgraf currently lives in Greeley, Colorado with his partner Daniela, and their cat Gilly. His two children Zoe and 
    Maximus, are also proud graduates of the University of Colorado. Outside of dentistry, he enjoys skiing, cycling, playing
    the mandolin, spending time outdoors, and cheering on the Nuggets, Avalanche, and Broncos.
    </p>
  <p>
Moving to the mountains has always been a dream for Dr. Markgraf. He is grateful for the opportunity to live and practice in 
    Steamboat. He looks forward to building meaningful relationships with patients and providing compassionate, conservative 
    dental care to the community he now calls home. 
    </p>
  <p>
Dr. Joy feels fortunate to welcome a colleague who shares her values of empathy, careful attention to detail, and clear 
    communication. She trusts Dr. Markgraf’s dental experience wholeheartedly and is confident in the quality of care he
    provides. Dr. Joy extends her sincere gratitude to her patients for their continued trust and support, as the practice 
    grows within our wonderful community. Please join us in welcoming Dr. Markgraf to Rabbit Ears Dental.

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Our practice philosophy is to provide the community of Routt County with comfortable, modern, and affordable dental care.  
      Just because we live in rural Colorado, we shouldnâ€™t have to compromise our oral health.  To that end, our aim is to provide oral 
      healthcare at the highest level that is accessible to every member of our community.

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <h4>Intra-Oral Camera</h4>
    <p>
      Our practice is outfitted with the most up to date intraoral cameras.  
      These devices allow your doctor to better communicate your potential problems, 
      and the means by which we can resolve it.
    </p>
    <h4>Iso-dry</h4>
    <p>
      Iso-dry is the latest technology in dental isolation.  This comfortable device allows easier visibility and more efficient saliva removal.  
      This isolation is paramount when providing modern adhesive dentistry and insures a long-lasting restoration.
    </p>
    <h4>Electric Handpieces</h4>
    <p>
      Old air-driven handpieces are noisy and uncomfortable.  Our practice is updated with electric handpieces 
      in every operatory in order to make your visit more efficient and comfortable.
    </p>
    <h4>Digital Xrays</h4>
    <p>
      We utilize digital intra-oral and panoramic x-rays. Digital x-rays allow significantly lower exposure to patients, while yielding an extremely
      high resolution product. This results in more sensitive and accurate diagnoses, resulting in more efficient dental care.
    </p>
    <h4>Dental Loupes</h4>
    <p>
      Dr. Troxel utilizes dental loupes to perform all dental procedures procedures under high magnification. These loupes illuminate 
      and magnify an otherwise dark and minute area. 
    </p>
    <h4>Ultrasonics</h4>
    <p>
      Our hygienists utilize ultrasonic activated instruments, which allow for a more thorough cleaning at your next visit.  
      These instruments help to gently vibrate off your dental plaque rather than a simple scrubbing or scraping, which can
      be inefficient and painful.
